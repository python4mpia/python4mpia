The easiest option is to use the Free Enthought Python Distribution
(EPDFree).  `Enthought <http://www.enthought.com>`_ sponsors much of
the development for `NumPy`_ and `SciPy`_. EPDFree is a bundled binary
distribution of Python including a set of useful packages.

It is also possible to install the necessary packages using
Macports. This is one way to get a 64-bit Python installation on a
Mac, which isn't available with EPDFree.

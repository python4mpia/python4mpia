Modules, Packages, and all that
=================================

One of the key features of Python is that the actual core language is fairly
small.  This is an intentional design feature to maintain simplicity.  Much of
the powerful functionality comes through external modules and packages.  

The main work of installation so far has been to supplement the core Python
with useful modules for science analysis.

**Module**

A `module <http://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html>`_ is simply a file
containing Python definitions, functions, and statements.  Putting code into
modules is useful because of the ability to `import
<http://docs.python.org/reference/simple_stmts.html#import>`_ the module
functionality into your script or IPython session, for instance::

  import atpy
  data = atpy.Table('my_table.fits')

You'll see ``import`` in virtually every Python script and soon it will be
second nature.  

*Question*: 
  Importing modules and putting the module name in front is such a bother, 
  why do I need to do this?

*Answer*: 
  It keeps everything modular and separate.  For instance many modules have a
  ``read()`` function since this is a common thing to do.  Without using the
  ``<module>.<function>(...)`` syntax there would be no way to know which one
  to call.

.. Tip::

  Sometimes it is convenient to make an end-run around the ``<module>.`` 
  prefixing.  For instance when you run ``ipython -pylab`` the interpreter
  does some startup processing so that a number of functions 
  from the `numpy`_ and `matplotlib`_ modules are available *without*
  using the prefix.
  
  Python allows this with this syntax::

    from <module> import *
  
  That means to import every function and definition from the module into the
  current namespace (in other words make them available without prefixing).
  For instance you could do::
  
    from atpy import *
    data = Table('my_table.fits')
  
  A general rule of thumb is that ``from <module> import *`` is OK for
  interactive analysis within IPython but you should avoid using it within
  scripts.

**Package**

A `package <http://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html#packages>`_ is just a
way of collecting related modules together within a single tree-like
hierarchy.  Very complex packages like `NumPy`_ or `SciPy`_ have hundreds of
individual modules so putting them into a directory-like structure keeps things
organized and avoids name collisions.  For example here is a partial list
of sub-packages available within `SciPy`_

================================== ======================================================
scipy.fftpack                      Discrete Fourier Transform algorithms 
scipy.stats                        Statistical Functions 
scipy.lib                          Python wrappers to external libraries 
scipy.lib.blas                     Wrappers to BLAS library 
scipy.lib.lapack                   Wrappers to LAPACK library 
scipy.integrate                    Integration routines 
scipy.linalg                       Linear algebra routines 
scipy.sparse.linalg                Sparse Linear Algebra 
scipy.sparse.linalg.eigen          Sparse Eigenvalue Solvers 
scipy.sparse.linalg.eigen.arpack   Eigenvalue solver using iterative methods. 
================================== ======================================================

  functions it provides.


Finding and installing other packages
--------------------------------------

If you've gotten this far you have a working scientific Python environment that
has *most* of what you will ever need.  Nevertheless it is almost certain that
you will eventually find a need that is not met within your current
installation.  Here we learn **where** to find other useful packages and
**how** to install them. 

Package resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. sidebar:: Good vs. bad resources

   When you find some package on the web, look for a few things:
   
      - Good modern-looking documentation with examples
      - Installs easily without lots of dependencies (or has detailed
        installation instructions)
      - Actively developed

Google
#######

Google "python blah blah" or "python astronomy blah blah"

Resource lists
###############

There are a number of sites specifically devoted to Python for astronomy with
organized lists of useful resources and packages.

  - `Astropython.org resources <http://www.astropython.org/resources>`_
  - `Comfort at 1 AU
    <http://oneau.wordpress.com/2010/10/02/python-for-astronomy/>`_
  - `Astronomical Python <http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/rowen/AstroPy.html>`_

PyPI
#######

The `Python Package Index <http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_ is the main
repository for 3rd party Python packages (about 14000 packages and growing).
An increasing number of `astronomy related packages
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=browse&show=all&c=385&c=387>`_
are available on PyPI, but this list misses a lot of available options.

The advantage of being on PyPI is the ease of installation using
``pip install <package_name>``.  

.. admonition:: Exercise: Find packages for coordinate manipulations

  Find one or more Python packages that will transform coordinates from Galactic to FK5 ecliptic.
  
  *Hint*: tags are helpful at astropython.org and don't forget the "next" button at
  the bottom.

Package installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two standard methods for installing a package. 

**pip install**

The ``pip install`` script is available within our scientific Python
installation and is very easy to use (when it works).  During the installation
process you already saw many examples of ``pip install`` in action.  Features include:

  - If supplied with a package name then it will query the PyPI site to find out about
    that package.  Assuming the package is there then ``pip install`` will
    automatically download and install the package.  
  - Will accept a local tar file (assuming it contains an installable Python package) or a URL
    pointing to a tar file.
  - Can install in the user package area via ``pip install <package or URL>
    --user`` (see discussion further down)

**python setup.py install**

Some packages may fail to install via ``pip install``.  Most often there will
be some obvious (or not) error message about compilation or missing
dependency.  In this case the likely next step is to download the installation tar
file and untar it.  Go into the package directory and look for files like::

  INSTALL
  README
  setup.py
  setup.cfg

If there is an INSTALL or README file then hopefully you will find useful
installation instructions.  Most well-behaved python packages do the
installation via a standard ``setup.py`` script.  This is used as follows::

  python setup.py --help  # get options
  python setup.py install # install in the python area (root / admin req'd)
  python setup.py install --user # install to user's package area

More information is available in the `Installing Python Modules
<http://docs.python.org/install/index.html>`_ page.

.. Admonition:: What is pip and easy_install and distribute and setuptools?

   Things can appear very confusing if you start installing packages
   on your own and looking through various projects and installation
   documentation.  First there was the ``distutils`` standard library
   module that specifies what a package provides and how it gets
   installed.  But this had some shortcomings and a 3rd party
   extension named ``setuptools`` was developed and adopted fairly
   widely.  In conjunction with ``setuptools`` was a script
   ``easy_install`` that took care of downloading, untarring,
   building, and installing packages.  Pretty good, except that the
   developer of both these stopped actively developing them.

   So some people took matters into their own hands and did a
   "friendly fork" of ``setuptools`` named ``distribute``. Now
   ``distribute`` is the standard, and likewise ``pip`` has replaced
   ``easy_install`` as the best (and actively developed) easy
   installer.


Where do packages get installed?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An important option in the installation process is where to put the package
files.  We've seen the ``--user`` option in ``pip install`` and ``python
setup.py install``.  What's up with that?  In general, if you don't have to you
should not use ``--user``, but see the discussion in `Multiple Pythons on
your computer`_ for a reason you might.

WITH ``--user``
################

Packages get installed in a local user-owned directory when you do something
like either of the following::

  pip install --user asciitable 
  python setup.py install --user

This puts the packages into:

=======  ==============================================
Mac      ~/Library/Python/2.x/lib/python/site-packages
Linux    ~/.local/lib/python-2.x/site-packages
Windows  %APPDATA%/Python/Python2x/site-packages
=======  ==============================================

.. Note::
  On Mac if you did not use the EPD Python Framework then you may see user
  packages within ``~/.local/lib`` as for linux.  This depends on whether Python
  is installed as a MacOS Framework or not.

WITHOUT ``--user``
###################

This option requires root or admin privilege because the package will be
installed in the system area instead of your own local directories. 

Installing this way has the benefit of making the package available for all users of the
Python installation, but has the downside of possibly breaking things in a way
that is difficult to repair (see next topic).

How do I find a package once installed?
#######################################

Finding the file associated with a package or module is simple, just use the ``help``
command in IPython::

  import scipy
  help scipy

This gives something like::

  NAME
      scipy

  FILE
      /usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/scipy/__init__.py

  DESCRIPTION
      SciPy: A scientific computing package for Python
      ================================================
      
      Documentation is available in the docstrings and
      online at http://docs.scipy.org.
      ... 

Uninstalling packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is no simple and fully consistent way to do this.  The Python
community is working on this one.  In most simple cases, however, you can just
delete the module file or directory that is revealed by the technique shown above.

Getting help on package installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you attempt to install a package but it does not work, your basic options are:

  - Dig in your heels and start reading the error messages to see why it is
    unhappy.  Often when you find a specific message it's time to start
    googling by pasting in the relevant parts of the message.
  - Send an email to the `AstroPy
    <http://mail.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/astropy>`_ mailing list
    astropy@scipy.org.  Include:

      - Package you are trying to install
      - URL for downloading the package tar file
      - Your platform (machine architecture and exact OS version)
      - Exactly what you typed
      - Entire output from the ``python setup.py install`` process

    Do NOT just write and say "I tried to install BLAH and it failed, can 
    someone help?"
  

Multiple Pythons on your computer
---------------------------------

Apart from being a scary thought, this is a practical problem that you are
likely to encounter.  Straight away you probably have the system Python
(/usr/bin) and the EPD Python.  Then if you install PyRaf, CIAO, and CASA you
will get one more Python installation for each analysis package (there are good
reasons for this).  **In general, different Python installations cannot
reliably share packages or resources**.  Each installation should be considered
as its own local Python universe.

Installing within each Python
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that you know about all the great packages within our Scientific Python
installation, you might want to start using them in your PyRaf or CASA
or CIAO analysis.

If you start digging into Python you will likely come across the technique of
setting the ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable to extend the list of search
paths that Python uses to look for a module.  Let's say you are using CIAO
Python and want to use SciPy functions.  You might be tempted to set
``PYTHONPATH`` to point to the directory in EPD where the SciPy modules live.
This will fail because the EPD Python modules were compiled and linked assuming
they'll be run with EPD Python.  With effort you might find a way to make this
work, but in general it's not a workable solution.

What *will* often work is to follow the package installation procedure for
each desired package within each Python installation.  This assumes that you
have write permission into the directories where the analysis package files
live.  Simply enter the appropriate analysis environment, then do then
following:

- Download http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pip/pip-1.0.1.tar.gz
- Untar that file, go in the tar directory, and do ``python setup.py install``
- Now you can do ``pip install <package>`` for each desired package within
  that analysis environment.

It's worth noting that the original example of SciPy will not install with
``pip``.  It requires a very tricky installation from source, so unless SciPy
ships with your favorite analysis environment you are out of luck with that
one.

If you do *not* have write access to the analysis package directories, then you
need to use the ``--prefix`` option in ``pip`` to install in a local area and
then set a corresponding ``PYTHONPATH``.

Can we share packages?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are careful there is a way to get limited sharing between Pythons.  The
first rule is that they need to be the same major version, i.e. all 2.6 or 2.7.
This is because Python always includes a major version like ``python2.6/`` in
the default search path so Python 2.7 will never find 2.6 packages.  The second
rule is to install packages using the ``--user`` option in ``pip install`` or
``setup.py install``.  This results in the situation shown below where each
Python can find common packages in the local user area:

.. image:: antisocial_pythons_trans.png
   :width: 650

Be sure to test that the package you installed works within the other Python
environments.

.. Caution::
   
   Be very wary of installing a package with ``--user`` if one of your Python
   installations already contains that package.  This is because the local user
   version will always take precedence and thus potentially upset that Python
   installation.  Big analysis packages like CIAO or CASA are carefully tested
   assuming the integrated environment they provide.  If you start mucking this
   up then all bets are off.


Final exercises
---------------

.. admonition:: Exercise [intermediate]: Fully install APLpy

  Go to the `APLpy install page <http://aplpy.github.com/install.html>`_ and
  read the instructions.  Manually install all of the Python package dependencies with the
  ``--user`` option or try the auto-install script available there.

  For extra credit install the `Montage
  <http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu/>`_ C library as discussed on the APLpy
  install page.  Then try to run the example `Making a publication quality plot
  <../intro/quick-tour.html#making-a-publication-quality-image>`_ that was shown
  in the introductory talk.  The necessary input files are in the
  ``install_examples.tar`` file.

.. admonition:: Exercise [intermediate]: Install HDF5 and PyTables

  Install `HDF5 <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`_ and
  `PyTables <http://www.pytables.org/moin>`_.  This will let you read HDF5 tables
  in Python.  HDF5 is a data file format which can store and manipulate extremely
  large or complex datasets in a scalable manner.  It is the baseline for some data-heavy
  facilities such as LOFAR.

.. admonition:: Exercise [expert]: Install SciPy and all dependencies from source

  Attempt to follow the instructions for building from source in the `Installing
  SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/Installing_SciPy>`_ page.  (No binary downloads!).
  This will be useful if you want to use the very latest development version of
  Python or else want to use the system-dependent build optimization so your
  numerical libraries are the fastest possible.  For most people this is not needed.

  If you can do this then consider yourself an expert on Python installation.

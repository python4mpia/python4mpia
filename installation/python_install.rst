Installing a scientific Python distribution
===========================================

In order to run the examples to be presented in the workshops, your
Python installation will need to meet the
:ref:`python_pkg_requirements`.  Unless you are confident with (and
enjoy) tracking down compiler errors and other issues related to
package incompatibilities, we strongly recommend using a pre-built
binary Python distribution.  For MacOS in particular there are many
options for Python which don't play well together.  Even if you
already have an installation on your system you will probably save
time in the long run by starting fresh with a binary Python
distribution.

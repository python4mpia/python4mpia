Installing Python and the rest
------------------------------

In order to follow along the tutorial sessions you need to have Python 2.6 or
2.7 installed and satisfy these :ref:`python_pkg_requirements`.  Please look
ahead to the workshop on :ref:`installing_scientific_python`.  You are
encouraged to attempt the installation on your own, but at the very least you
should download the necessary package files for your configuration in advance
of the session.

Summary
==========================

In particular, we have learned how to:

* numerically integrate with Scipy,
* minimise a function with Scipy,
* conduct linear-algebra operations with Numpy,
* compute Fourier transforms with Numpy,
* compare merger rates in active/inactive galaxies,
* analytically fit linear models to data,
* not estimate optimal polynomial order from data.

Some general conclusions:

* Numpy and Scipy provide a wealth of mathematical functions that substantially simplify your life as a scientist.
* This functionality by far outmatches what you can get in IDL - both in diversity and in quality.
* Numpy and Scipy have what you need: Do not reinvent the wheel!

Finally, you are now equipped with the basic knowledge to start using Numpy and Scipy. If you should encounter any serious problems, feel free to contact the Python mailing list at MPIA.

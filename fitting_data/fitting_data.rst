An introduction to fitting data using Numpy & Scipy
===============================

Numpy and Scipy are two very important packages when using Python for scientific work. Both packages provide powerful methods, e.g., matrix operations, numerical integration, statistical distributions.

Goals of this session
----------------

* How to use Numpy: matrices & linear algebra.
* How to use Scipy: numerical integration.
* How to compare population proportions.
* How to fit linear models. 
* Never trust p-values or reduced :math:`\chi^2`.
* Review some basic plotting.

At the end of this session, participants will have code fragments that can be readily used or easily adopted for their own scientific work.

Furthermore, participants are then familiar with the basic concepts of Numpy and Scipy, such that they know how to learn more complicated things themselfes.
